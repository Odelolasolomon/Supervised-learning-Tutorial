    "##  Introduction to the Dataset\n",
    "In the previous lesson, we looked at the machine learning workflow and trained a simple classifier to predict if a patient has breast cancer. We learned how we can quickly prototype a machine learning model and experiment with it to get reasonable results.\n",
    "While there is a benefit to being able to quickly experiment and iterate, not understanding how the algorithm for a model actually works can impact the outcome of those random experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll learn a different machine learning algorithm and implement it from scratch. We'll use it to build and train a classifier that can predict whether a bank customer will subscribe to a term deposit or not.We'll use a modified version of the Bank Marketing Dataset https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing. It contains data on customers of a Portuguese banking institution that ran marketing campaigns to assess whether customers would subscribe to their product. The dataset consists of 21 columns, including the target variable:\n",
    "- age: (numeric)\n",
    "- job: type of job (categorical: 'admin.','blue collar','entrepreneur','housemaid','management','retired','self employed','services','student','technician','unemployed','unknown')\n",

    "- duration: last contact duration, in seconds (numeric).\n",
    "- campaign: number of contacts performed during this campaign and for this client (numeric, includes last contact)\n",
    "- pdays: number of days that passed by after the client was last contacted from a previous campaign (numeric; 999 means client was not previously contacted)\n",
    "- previous: number of contacts performed before this campaign and for this client (numeric)\n",
    "- poutcome: outcome of the previous marketing campaign (categorical: 'failure','nonexistent','success')\n",
    "- emp.var.rate: employment variation rate - quarterly indicator (numeric)\n",

    "In order to split the dataset, we could take a direct approach of selecting the first N observations as the training set and the rest as the test set. But that poses a problem. We don't know how many observations of those N have a label of 0 and how many have a label of 1.\n",

    "Even though our dataset has a reasonably balanced class distribution, we need to make sure that both the train and test sets have a similar percentage of subscribed customers.\n",

For example, the collection process could've added the newest clients first. If we were to select the first N observations, we could be introducing bias into our model. That's why, when creating our training and test sets, randomly selecting observations is important, as it can help reduce any such biases.\n",

    "### Feature Selection\n",
    "We previously either used all the features in our dataset to build and train a model or randomly selected a handful of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "While both can be appropriate approaches to train a model, they aren't necessarily the best ones. We've already observed how our models didn't always perform as well as we'd hoped in either of those scenarios.Not all features in a dataset might be relevant to a model's performance. Identifying and removing such features in the data preparation step, before training a model, can not only boost its performance, but also reduce the computational cost. The latter is especially important when we have to work with large datasets and complex machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Random selection.**\n",
    "- We've utilized this in the previous lesson by selecting features at random.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Domain Expertise.**\n",
    "- For example, one of the features is euribor3m. A reasonable understanding of what Euribor is could inform of us whether it is likely to have any impact on the prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Identifying features that are strongly correlated to our target variable**\n",
    "We'll learn about other approaches later. For now, we'll calculate the Pearson Correlation Coefficient on our columns to identify which features are strongly correlated to the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could also plot the heat map for those values to make it easier to identify those features. Since the categorical columns of our dataset have been one-hot encoded, we have over fifty features in our dataset right now. Creating a heat map using all those pairs will make it difficult to identify correlations"

    "Each neighbor in the above algorithm is given the same weight--no neighbor is more important or relevant than another. When creating our model, this is the same as setting the weights parameter to **uniform.** All neighbors have a uniform impact when our model decides on a class for the new data point.\n",
    "Is that what we want every time? What if our dataset had 1000 points corresponding to one label and only 200 corresponding to the other?\n",
    "\n",
    "We might end up with a higher likelihood of selecting the former class instead of the latter if all neighbors were considered equally. Our model would be biased towards one class. A potential solution to that is to assign weights to those neighbors.\n",
    "We calculate the distance of each neighbor from the unknown data point. We assign a weight equal to the inverse of that distance. The closer the neighbor to the new point, the more likely the new point belongs to the same class.\n",
    "This comes with its own potential drawbacks. For example, the additional computations will add to our computational costs. The model might also overfit the data, since it would start to learn from the closest features instead of generalizing appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we didn't fully understand how k-NNs work, we might not have understood this specific example of a weighted k-NN, or thought about where it could be potentially useful. Hyperparameter optimization allows us to quickly iterate through different values without thinking about how they impact the model. But it's still important to understand the underlying algorithm as often as possible."

    "Previously, modifying two more hyperparameters improved our model's performance corresponding to some of the K's, but the rest worsened. Not every attempt will result in improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can't always try every possible permutation and combination. Depending on the size of the dataset, the number of hyperparameters, and the range of values they could take, it would be computationally expensive.We can try out a smaller subset of values. A commonly used approach that can help us find the optimal hyperparameter values is called **grid search.**\n",
    "\n",
    "We've already applied this technique, in part. In the grid search technique, we define a grid of hyperparameter values. This grid contains the range of values for different hyperparameters we want to explore and train our model with.\n",
    "We created a list containing the number of neighbors we wanted to use to train our model. That was an example of such a grid. We then expanded the grid by setting the values for two more hyperparameters. We could expand the grid further by having multiple nested loops to explore different combinations of hyperparameters and their values.\n",
    "We don't need to keep creating multiple loops ourselves. We can use Scikit-learn's GridSearchCV https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html to conduct this search.\n",
    "GridSearchCV allows us to input a dictionary of hyperparameters and the values we want to search. Additionally, GridSearchCV automatically evaluates the different models on validation sets it creates from the training data. It simplifies our workflow in that regard"
