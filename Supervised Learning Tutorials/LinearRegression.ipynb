    "\n",
    "Welcome to Introduction To Linear Regression! This is the first of four lessons in the Linear Regression Modeling in Python course. Now that we've learned about the main types of machine learning (ML), it's time to explore specific models. Along the way, we'll learn different ML concepts by observing their use in fundamental models.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the course title suggests, the focus of this entire course will be linear regression. Linear regression is a fantastic model to start from because it's one of the \"workhorse\" models used in a wide variety of fields, including business, science, and medicine. No matter how far you go in your ML journey with more complex models, the simplicity and usefulness of linear regression will always be valuable. Linear regressions are often the first model we turn to for an understanding of how two different phenomena relate.\n",

    "### Defining Regression\n",
    "A great place to start with linear regression is the concept of regression itself. A regression (or regression analysis) is a technique that attempts to model the relationship between two sets of variables. One set of variables, called **predictors**, includes variables that we think influence the value of other variables of interest, which we refer to as the outcome. **(We also call predictors \"features\" or \"covariates.\")** A regression analysis tries to determine just how these predictors relate to the outcome, and we think of this mathematically as a function:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='lrfunction.png' width=400 height=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The function **f** is what we call the regression. By using a regression, we're assuming that the value of **Y** can be split into two components:\n",
    "The first part, f(X) describes how the predictors contribute to the outcome. The second part, ϵ, is called **error or noise.**The ϵ is there to essentially fill in the gap between f(X) and Y**.\n",
    "(We will see later that this error is important for evaluating our models. The focus of this lesson is to understand **f(X)** which is the regression.\n",
    "We also assume that the outcome Y is a numerical variable, as opposed to binary or categorical. For example, let's say that **Y** represents a risk score for a particular car. A higher risk score means that insurance premiums are higher. Let's also say that **X** represents the engine power. We might be interested in determining how the engine size relates to the risk score of the car. We can use regression to examine this association.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"linear\" in linear regression suggests that **f(X)** has a particular form. It assumes that the outcome **Y** can be described as a linear combination of the predictors, as shown below:\n",

Parameters are values that need to be learned from the data, and we use them to calculate the relationship between the predictors and outcome.

Nothing stops us from adding multiple predictors into a model, which turns it into a multiple linear regression.\n",

    "### Types of Predictors\n",
    "Now that we know what our outcome **Y** is for the linear regression, it's time to consider the nature of predictors **X**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two categories of variables: **numerical and categorical**. As their name suggests, numerical variables contain numbers. These numbers can be discrete, taking on just a few values, or continuous, taking on any value in an interval. The height variable is a classic example of this.\n",
    "The body_style column is an example of a categorical variable. Categorical variables indicate that the car belongs to a particular group. Categorical variables also include binary (i.e., \"yes or no\", 0 or 1) variables to indicate that a car either does or does not belong to a particular group.\n",
    "The nature of the predictors can affect how they appear in the regression. Numerical predictors, such as length or height, can be included directly into a linear regression. We can't say the same for categorical variables.\n",
    "If a categorical predictor contains three or more groups, then the categories need to be split up into separate dummy variables to be added into a linear regression. Each dummy variable will be 1 or 0, depending on whether or not the car is in a particular group. Furthermore, if a categorical predictor contains k predictors, then k−1 dummy variable will be used in the linear regression. The remaining category will be used as a \"reference.\" We will explain the precise reason behind this in detail later. For now, it's crucial to understand how categorical variables are handled.\n",
    "For example, let's say we want to include drive_wheels in a linear regression. drive_wheels has three categories (\"4wd\", \"fwd\" and \"rwd\"). If \"4wd\" is the reference, then the regression would have two new predictors corresponding to binary variables. One will correspond to if the car is \"fwd\" or not, while the other will do the same for \"rwd.\" If both of these columns are 0, then the car is \"4wd.\"\n"

Instead, we'll use the scikit-learn library, which takes all of that hand calculation and abstracts it away into a useful function. Before we do so, it's important to know why and how scikit-learn does what it does, which we learned in this lesson.\n",

    "## Interpreting Regression Parameters\n",
    "Welcome to the second lesson in the Linear Regression Modeling in Python course. In the previous lesson, we learned about the **linear regression model**, and we derived how to calculate the coefficients using only the data. However, doing all of this every time can slow us down from actually using our models to make predictions. This is why Python libraries like scikit-learn are important: these libraries provide functions that abstract away the calculations so we can get straight to the modeling.\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll learn how to create a linear regression model using the scikit-learn library to estimate the coefficients. To create the model, we'll also learn a general strategy for choosing potential predictors. Finally, we'll look more in-depth at the coefficients of a linear regression model. One of the main strengths of linear regression is that it lends itself well to meaningful interpretations. That means the coefficients tell us how the predictor associates with the outcome.\n"

The scikit-learn library dedicates an entire module to various types of linear models, including linear regression. (This module is aptly called linear_model.) Within this module is a class called LinearRegression, which we'll use for our linear regressions. In order to use the LinearRegression class, we need to import it, just like we've done with pandas and numpy. We can do this as follows:\n",

The LinearRegression class is only the \"blueprint\" for the model, so we actually have to create, or instantiate it, as an object. We can do this by calling the class and assigning it to a variable, as follows:\n",
    "By assigning the class to a variable and using the parentheses, we're creating a new LinearRegression() object. This new object hasn't been fit to any data yet, so there's not much we can do with it.

In the case of categorical variables, a unit change represents the change in the outcome for being in the non-reference category.

    "In this lesson, we learned how to fit a linear regression using the scikit-learn library instead of doing it ourselves. Libraries make it easier to produce models, and they eliminate the need to worry about the calculation. From there, we learned how to interpret each of the coefficients, both in simple and multiple linear regressions. We can get to these interpretations by figuring out how to isolate each one. The intercept represents the average outcome when all of the predictors are 0, while the slopes represent changes in the average outcome for unit increases in the predictor. \"Unit changes\" have different interpretations in the context of categorical predictors, so keep this in mind.\n",

    "## Applying Linear Regression Models\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the final lesson in the Linear Regression Modeling in Python course. We've learned how to create a model and how to evaluate it using various metrics. like residuals,. mse,rmse and coefficient of determination.Equipped with these metrics, we can finally evaluate the predictive ability of a linear regression model. So far, we've only checked some metrics using the training data to get a general sense of the magnitude of the error. Since the parameters are optimized on the training data, we should consider the training metrics to be overly optimistic.\n",
    "The solution is to calculate the metrics on the test dataset. The test dataset is data that the model hasn't seen yet, so we would expect performance to be worse here. Our hope is that the test error isn't too far from the training error. What we mean by \"error\" can depend on the model, data and cost function we are using. In the case of linear regression, the error will be the mean squared error (MSE).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, once we understand how well a model works, we may seek to improve it. These improvements can take the form of different predictors or more complex predictors in the model. We'll explore this feature selection in this lesson"

    "### Test Error\n",
    "In a supervised machine learning problem, we want to create a model that produces the most accurate predictions possible. We don't use the training error to judge the predictive ability of a model because it's too optimistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we compare candidate models to use, we'll ultimately judge them based on their test error. The smaller the error, the better.\n",
    "Computing the test error is the same process as computing the training error, except we use the test dataset instead. Since the test error is also an MSE, we can also take its square root to derive the root mean squared error (RMSE), which is on the same scale as the outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "We hope that the test error will be close to or smaller than the training error. This will be the case if the model is adequately general. We might be tempted to create a more complex model using polynomials or splines in order to further push down the training error.\n",
    "The danger that comes with more complex models is that they might simply be learning the structure of the training data. When we apply this more complex model to the test data, our test error will be much higher than the training error. This is the issue of **overfitting**.\n",

    "### Feature Selection And Correlation\n",
    "The process of creating a predictive model should not be viewed as an open-and-closed process. Once we know the test MSE, we have an idea of how the model might predict on unseen data. If we feel that the test error was reasonable, then we might want to use it on future datasets. If not, we might want to iterate on our linear model and try to push down the test MSE even further.\n",
    "There are several ways that we can do this. We might want to consider another class of models entirely or use different predictors. We'll focus on the latter here in the context of linear regression. The process of choosing predictors to include in a model is called feature selection. \"Predictors\" have many alternative names, and \"feature\" is one of them. We'll explore this idea over the next few screens.One of the ideas behind feature selection is that we can improve a model's predictive ability if we can choose predictors that are highly correlated with the outcome. High correlation between a predictor and the outcome implies that changes in the predictor will also come with predictable changes to the outcome. If a predictor wasn't correlated with the outcome, then changes in the predictor would be uninformative.\n",
    "Correlation is applicable only to continuous predictors and outcomes, but we can extend a similar idea to categorical variables. Recall that when categorical variables are used in linear regression models, they represent changes in the average outcome when the observation is a non-reference category. Using this idea, if we plot the histograms of the outcome stratified by different categories, we can check if using the categories might be useful.\n",

    "### Outcome Transformations\n",
    "On the past two screens, we've discussed more complex predictors that could be included to improve predictive power. On this screen, we'll shift focus to transformations of the outcome.\n",
    "Transforming the outcome serves a different purpose than transforming a predictor. Recall from our lesson on checking model fit that the residuals of a model should form an even band around zero when checked against the predicted values. That is, they should have constant variance. In some cases, the outcome itself might have several extreme values at either the low or high end. These extreme values can influence the estimated coefficients and cause the residuals to deviate from constant variance.\n",
    "In these cases, it might be useful to transform the outcome so that extreme values are less pronounced. One of the most common ways to do this is the **log-transformation**. Using this transformation means **we're trying to predict the log of the outcome instead of the outcome itself:**\n",

   "source": [
    "The log transformation is useful when the outcome spans several magnitudes (i.e., from tens to ten-thousands) or has extreme values. By reducing the \"extremeness\" of outcomes, we are trying to ensure the model has constant variance in the residuals. It's not guaranteed, but it can help sometimes.\n",
    "Note that calculating the MSE on the transformed outcome causes the RMSE to also be in terms of the transformation. In order to understand the RMSE in terms of the original outcome scale, we need to inverse the original transformation. For example if we calculate the MSE on log(Y), we'll need to use e raised to power RMSE to get it back on the original scale.\n",
    "Even though the normalized_losses column doesn't have the problem of extreme values, we'll practice using an outcome transformation below."

    "\n",
    "As we finish this course, let's look back to the process we've learned. We've examined the auto dataset to understand how to best predict the normalized_losses column, using different characteristics of each car. Since we know the values of the normalized losses, this is a supervised learning problem. To approach this problem, we studied the linear regression model and how to evaluate and use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've constructed a few of these models, we should consider how to communicate our findings to other people. Often, these other people might be collaborators, non-technical coworkers, or even a general audience. It might be too dense to include every detail of our analysis, so we should reduce it to the essential details.\n",
    "When dealing with machine learning, we should be transparent about the data and the process we used to select a final model. Here's a non-exhaustive list of questions we should consider when summarizing our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- How much data was used for training? What about the test set?\n",
    "- Did we have to make any transformations to the outcome or predictors? If so, what justification did we make to do so?\n",
    "- What predictors did we include in the model? Were there any particular reasons they were included?\n",
    "- How well does our model predict unseen data? Is the level of error acceptable for its application?\n",
    "- Ideally, these observations would be made as we perform each step of the machine learning workflow, culminating in a final summary at the end."

    "### Review\n",
    "Congratulations on finishing the Linear Regression Modeling in Python course! In this lesson, we learned about linear regression and how to complete the process of creating, interpreting, and evaluating the model. Linear regressions are a simple model, but they are often a good starting point before advancing to more complex algorithms. Despite the simplicity of linear models, working with them is a good way to understand how and why to evaluate a model. Even the most complex supervised models need evaluation against some cost function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regressions can also be much more complex than we've covered here — take these lessons as an introduction. For example, models like the LASSO and Ridge regression are examples of linear models — but with the extra consideration of regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're now ready to complete the guided project, where we will see a new dataset."
